# hystrix-event-stream-clj

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/hystrix-event-stream-clj.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/josephwilk/hystrix-event-stream-clj)

Easy way to setup a Hystrix (https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) event stream without having to use servlets.

## Install

Add to your `project.clj`

https://clojars.org/hystrix-event-stream-clj

## Usage with Netty/Compojure

```clojure
 (:require [hystrix-event-stream-clj.core as hystrix-event])

 (defroutes app (GET "/hystrix.stream" (hystrix-event/stream))
```

Test the event stream by curling:

```
curl locahost:5000/hystrix.stream

data: []

data: []
```

## But Why?

The event stream can be consumed by the Hystrix Dashboard. Giving you pretty mointoring of all circuit breakers.

## How about with Jetty

With Jetty you can use the Netflix Hystrix Servlet directly. Here is an example of how:

```clojure
(import [com.netflix.hystrix.contrib.metrics.eventstream HystrixMetricsStreamServlet])
(import [org.eclipse.jetty.server Server])
(import [org.eclipse.jetty.servlet ServletContextHandler ServletHolder])

(require '[ring.util.servlet :as servlet])
(require '[ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty])

(defn run-jetty-with-hystrix [app options]
  (let [s (#'jetty/create-server options)
        ^QueuedThreadPool p (QueuedThreadPool. ^Integer (options :max-threads 50))]
    (when (:daemon? options false)
      (.setDaemon p true))
    (doto s
      (.setThreadPool p))
    (when-let [configurator (:configurator options)]
      (configurator s))

    (let [hystrix-holder  (ServletHolder. HystrixMetricsStreamServlet)
          app-holder (ServletHolder. (servlet/servlet app))
          context (ServletContextHandler. s "/" ServletContextHandler/SESSIONS)]
      (.addServlet context hystrix-holder "/hystrix.stream")
      (.addServlet context app-holder "/"))

    (.start s)
    (when (:join? options true)
      (.join s))
    s))


(defroutes app (GET "/hello" {:status 200 :body "Hello"})

(run-jetty-with-hystrix app {:port http-port :join? false})
```
